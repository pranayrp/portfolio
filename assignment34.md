Step one: Choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday.

I chose the following data visualization from MakeoverMonday<br>
https://www.forbes.com/lists/athletes/?sh=19ed0755b7eb

As someone studying about the entertainment and sports business, I am constantly fascinated by the numbers these mediums generate. I am also well aware of how powerful and impactful they are. Articles and numbers like these have the ability to impact young aspiring athletes if presented well, and considering how poorly the story was constructed and communicated by Forbes, I decided to choose this article & data visualization to redesign.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Two: Critique the data visualization<br>

Having viewed the above data visualization, as suggested, I used Stephen Few's critique method (Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile) to critique it.

Usefulness<br>
Rating: 2/10<br>
I personally didn’t find the data that useful. I would have found it more useful had the story and visualization been about the richness and money one gets if they work hard enough in their field of sports. The table and the article should have focused particularly on the ‘On-the-Field’ earnings of athletes, numbers that are directly proportional to the hardwork and journey of the athletes. However, that isn’t the story communicated. I am informed about Off-the-Field earnings too. Information that speaks more about the popularity of the sport than about the individual athletes hard work. As a result, an athlete’s total earnings becomes less effective to me even if it’s a big number.

Completeness<br>
Rating: 9/10<br>
All of the context has been provided. The article’s story is about the richest athletes in the world and the data visualization does dive into the numbers, and the breakdown of those numbers. There could have been another column called Date of Retirement so that viewers know why certain athletes like Tom Brady had abnormally higher off-the-field earnings than on-the-field earnings in 2023.

Perceptibility<br>
Rating: 5/10<br>
While the visualization is simple to read and flows in descending order of Total earnings, On-the Field earnings and Off-the-Field earnings should have been restrained to the inner columns and Total earnings should be moved towards the edge. The human perceives columns to add up to the last column and in this case, with columns being switched up, it took time to perceive what was going on. There’s also a lot of scrolling involved, because of which one loses track of the data to be ingested.

Truthfulness<br>
Rating: 10/10<br>
Considering it’s Forbes and having gone through the data, it’s validity and accuracy can be confirmed to be 100%. To Forbes credit, the list even values in Tom Brady’s earnings in the year 2023 even though he retired in Feb 2023. It was a value they could have missed and not included. But the team at Forbes were determined to ensure the list is as accurate as possible.

Intuitiveness<br>
Rating: 8/10<br>
Yes, the visualization is familiar and easily understood. It does take time to realize the actual data is just the ‘Names’ and ‘Total Earnings’ column. But once they are spotted, it’s fairly easy to understand the rest of the table.

Aesthetics<br>
Rating: 1/10<br>
No thought was putting into visualizing data. The visualization is basic. More thought should have been put into the visualization of these humongous numbers. They are instead communicated in a rather casual manner in a simple column with no special font touchups either.

Engagement<br>
Rating: 1/10<br>
I didn’t find the table engaging at all. I realized it’s just rows of data put together, and while I read the first few rows, I found myself just quickly scrolling through. They should have atleast bolded certain text, had a different font for different sports or given colors to different sports. They were many ways they could have retained engagement but they do not. They chose the simplest route possible - a route that so many are so familiar with that the data just does not stand out or isn’t paid enough attention to.

Google Spreadsheet Responses

Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently? <br>
In terms of the story of the data and the article, the focus is not on the ‘on-the-field’ earnings of athletes, which I personally think is more valuable info as it can be interpreted as the direct results of the athletes' hard work and performance all these years. The visualization fails to emphasize this aspect, instead giving equal weight to off-the-field earnings, which I personally feel is sometimes more dependent on the popularity of the sport than the athlete himself.
Perceptibility suffers due to the arrangement of columns, which can confuse viewers. Total Earnings should have been to the last column. Instead the columns that add up to make Total Earnings are placed to the right of it. The aesthetics and engagement of the visualization fall short. The simplicity of the design makes it unappealing and fails to capture attention effectively. The visualization is not effective the ‘bigness’ of the numbers these guys are making.
Completeness is generally good. All data pertaining to Total Earnings has been given. Even though it is not the story I prefer, the fact that the visualization gives a breakdown of on-the-field and off-the-field earnings has to be praised. If not for that breakdown, considering they are athletes, I would have assumed all earnings were On-the-field earnings by default. Additional context, such as the date of retirement for certain athletes, to provide clarity on why their off-the-field earnings might be higher.
Suggestions for improvement include incorporating visual elements like bold text, varied fonts for different sports, or color coding to make the data more visually engaging and easier to digest. In summary, while the data itself is comprehensive and accurate, the presentation lacks creativity and fails to engage the audience effectively. Enhancements in layout, design, and visualization techniques could significantly improve the overall impact and user experience.

Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not? <br>
I believe the primary audience are the young adults who are aspiring to be as big as these athletes one day. The visualization is not effective. It focuses on On-the-Field and Off-the-Field. If it focused only on On-the-field earnings, it would have been successful in communicating that if they work hard on their field of sport, they can earn this much one day. But, by bringing Off-the-Field earnings, a factor which is variable on the athlete’s media presence, PR team and probably even their looks, the article is calculating a variable factor and associating it with their success. A message that can be confusing or misleading to young adults. The last thing young adults looking to become sportsmen should wonder is if they also need to go through PR training to become successful.

Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) <br>
This method of evaluating data was extremely helpful. I prefer Stephen Few’s method over the Good Charts method. The Good Charts method was more about how I felt the moment I looked at the visualization and what I felt did and didn’t work. But Stephen Few's critique method is more detailed. It helped me focus on aspects to look at in the data visualization and critique it step-by-step. I believe my critique is much more comprehensive and elaborate as a result. Recommendations for improvement of visualization would be increased font for bigger numbers or bolding their text, color coding different sport categories, and changing the layout to a line graph or a bar graph

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Three: Sketch Out a Solution<br>

Having critiqued it, I decided to begin to think of ways to redesign this visualization. The images below displays the trial and errors I made along the way before arriving at what I believe was the solution.

As shown in the image,

In the first line graph, I put Earnings($) on y-axis and names of players on x-axis. I realized there’s too many players so scrolling and length of x-axis would quickly become an issue. At the same time, I also realized a line graph in most scenarios is used to depict progression. A reader might think the line graph moving upward or downward is part of the journey, when it’s not. Therefore, I decided to not go ahead with the line graph idea.

In the second graph, I wondered what if I just mapped the points of each players on the graph. The y-axis stayed $(earnings) and I kept the x-axis as the name of the sport. In each sport bracket, the players dots from that sport would appear and hovering over would give their total, on-the-field and off-the field earning. Overall, without hovering over, only the total earnings would be communicated. Also, there is possibly a better way to communicate On-the-field and Off-the field earnings. I however felt the graph could still work and decided to give it a shot while I’m working on tableau. I brainstormed further to see if I get a better solution.

In the third graph, I took the graph above and instead of the points, I filled it with mini-pies, where each pie would communicate the ratio of On-the-field and Off-the field earnings. While the graph did feel more aesthetically pleasing and new to me, I realized it now tougher to interpret the original idea of the graph - the total earnings of these athletes. I also realized audiences might not be so interested in the ratio and might be more interested in the number. I also wondered if tableau functionality existed for this. I decided to brainstorm further.

In the fourth graph to the bottom left, I decided to make a bar graph that split into two. The x-axis contains name of players and earnings on y-axis The shaded area would represent on-the-field and empty area would represent off-the-field. While overall the graph does display all the elements I intended to show, having the off-the-field above the on-the-field bar could create bias for off-the field earnings. I realized I have to make one small change and that I have the graph I need.<br>

In the fifth graph, the earnings are on the y-axis. The names of players are on the x-axis. It’s easier to scroll and interpret data this way. By shading both ‘on-the-field’ and ‘off-the-field’ with equally neutral colors, I would ensure there’s no bias view. I put the shaded version of the bar graph as ‘on-the-field’ earnings because I intend for the audience to notice/gain an estimate of that number next, after the total earnings number. I realized I have arrived on the graph for the assignment.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Four: Test the solution<br>

Having believed I have arrived at the right redesign for the Forbes list, I decided it’s best I get some feedback from some of my peers too to understand what they think of my solution and if there’s more I should do. I asked two students at Carnegie Mellon University, one in her 20s and the other in her 30s.

Student (in her early 20s) Feedback Session

What worked?: She quickly understood what the graph was. She liked my redesign idea and believed I had transformed a fairly simple boring dataset into an engaging interesting one.<br>
What didn’t work?: She suggested I add numbers beside each bar or at the end of the bar so that it would be simpler to understand the total earnings of each players. She also recommended that in the story I write, I should talk about certain outliers like Tom Brady, for whom the Off-the-field earnings are way higher than their on-the-field earnings and why it is like that.<br>
What questions came up?: My thought process behind the coloring of the bars? To which I explained why i chose blue and orange. Both colors are usually not associated with much. If i used a shade of green or a shade of red, it could be misconstrued to be the ‘correct’ data. Therefore, I stuck to blue and orange.<br>
What new inspiration arose?: With her suggestions about talking about outliers, I realized I have a better story to tell. One that could be used to tell the audience to also give equal importance to On-the-field earnings as they are to the Total earnings.


Student (in her late 30s) Feedback Session

What worked?: She liked how simple and effective it was. She was glad I retained information about On-the-field and off-the-field earnings in the graph and made their presence stand out.<br>
What didn’t work?: She suggested I add two more graphs called On-the-field earnings and Off-the-field earnings. Considering the top ten athletes would be different if the graphs are made, she believed these differences should be shown and detailed.<br>
What questions came up?: Why this data visualization? To which I replied how it bothered about how the data focuses on Off-the-field too when in actuality, the article’s audience is aspiring young athletes and they should therefore be shown On-the-field instead of Off-the-field.<br>
What new inspiration arose?: I realized by adding two more graphs for on-the-field and off-the-field earnings each and placing them right after the total-earnings graph, I could ensure readers focus on the On-the-Field earnings more. There would be a better flow and a better purpose to the story.<br>

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Five: Build your solution<br>

I began working on Tableau. When I first started, I decided I should attempt to draw my 2nd graph to see if it would be equally informative as the one I decided on and if it would satisfy all the feedback given. <br>
However, I soon realized the data and chart looked boring and it was definitely necessary to call out ‘On-the-field’ and ‘Off-the-field’ earnings. By adding images in the background, I assumed I could beautify the chart to make it more intriguing. I however realized as a result of adding images, I could not hover over each data point to learn about the player’s data. Tableau was hindering me from viewing the player’s data in the dashboard. After attempting every move in the manual book to figure a work around, I realized I should drop this and move on to the actual solution I prepared and gathered feedback for.

I began working on the finalized idea - bar graphs for Total Earnings, On the Field earnings and Off the field earnings. As displayed below, I made the bar graphs for each. I worked on improving their labels to ensure they were more readable.


 As I finished labeling and creating my bar graphs, I realized my colors play an important role in sending my message out. I therefore took more than an hour figuring which colors would be appropriate for On-the-Field and Off-the-field, such that the reader is more focused and inspired by On-the-Field earnings. Even in the Total Earnings chart, I strategically placed ‘On-the-Field’ earnings towards the increasing end for those reasons. I also realized it’s not possible to ignore the humongous contribution of Off-the-Field earnings. I therefore decided instead of completely dismissing ‘Off-the-field’ earnings, I should tell this story: 

If you (reader) become a good athlete, aside from the huge monetary benefits of being On-the-field, you will also receive huge monetary benefits Off-the-field. However, do note that the highest earnings made by a player were made On-the-field and not Off-the-field. So, focus on how you perform on the field.
