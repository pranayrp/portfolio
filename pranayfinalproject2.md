# User Research Protocol

## Target Audience
Initially, when I set off on this project, I intended for my visualization to speak to entertainment analytics companies. My intention was for them to realize the volumes of inferences this data could make about today's audience and thereby assist them in consulting for streaming platforms. However, as I dive deeper into this arena, I'm beginning to realize, my audience is also Netflix. Netflix, upon viewing my visualization, could realize coupling viewing hours with other data such as rotten tomatoes, runtime etc and releasing this information could also serve as a message to filmmakers. A messaage that conveys what genres today's audience is into, how many episodes are they willing to binge, should they focus on the plot or the characters. Such a message could empower filmmakers and help them make their Netflix pitches more aligned with the taste and mindset of today's audience. In the end, it is Netflix which benefits! 

I have picked 3 people to interview
1. 36-year-old Writer/Director who pitches to streaming platforms:- The reason I approached this person for an interview was I was curious if this data would actually be helpful to filmmakers pitching to streaming platforms. It can empower them and make them standout while pitching to the platform that they are aware of audience trends with Netflix products and have therefore configured their movie/series to align with that trend. In an industry that is just beginning to realize the power of data and analytics, I wanted to know what an insider would think of this. It is also often misread that tech is creating the art world. The intention is to enable artists, not surpress them. That's one thing I do wish my story speaks with my filmmaker acquaintance.
2. 26-year-old MSBA student @ Carnegie Mellon University:- The reason I approached this person for an interview was I wanted to ensure I was making the most out of the data I've collected. I want to exhaust all avenues to ensure I convey my message of how powerful Netflix's data can be.
3. 31-year-old PhD grad who has zero interest/idea about entertainment industry:- I felt the best review would come from someone who isn't at all into this field. If they find this interesting, I believe I am in right path. Hence, I chose this person to interview.

## The Interviews
*answers have been summaried and written in first-person perspective for ease of reading*
Note: The first and last question of each interview have been tailored according to the progress of the interview.

**36-year-old Writer/Director who pitches to streaming platforms**

Q1. Do you believe something like this would help you pitch to streaming platforms better? <br/>
A. Yes. While most filmmakers wish to say no, so as to stay true to their art. Not only is it tough to make a show for netflix, its even tougher to get a foot in the door. We rarely get chances to pitch. Therefore, when I do get a chance, having data such as this could help me push my show and give them an idea of the results it could produce. I might not write according to these trends and data. However, for the stories that I possess which already align with this data (ex. are 10 episodes and thriller), I would use this data to make my pitch more interesting and result oriented.

Q2. Which part of the story did you find most helpful/informative/fascinating? <br/>
The chart showing viewers' preference for # of episodes a season should possess was very informative. Once upon a time, a season used to have 23 episodes. It then became 13, then 10 and now there is no standard. Lately, a lot of shows have variable season lengths. Knowing number of episodes a season of a story should have is extremely necessary when one begins writing - one can map the character arc and plot structure if they knew that. However, we do want audience to stay tuned and hooked to the show while we do this exploration. So, it was interesting to know audiences prefer 8 episodes.

Q3. Any change I should make to the visualization to ensure data speaks to you better? <br/>
A. You should consider grouping the data. It doesn't make much of a difference to me if users prefer 117min over 120min. That's extremely minimal difference in filmmaker language and therefore, even if our product ends up being 3min more, we will not cut it. It'd be better if it were instead grouped as 120+ min, 110+min. Segmenting would be more helpful in conveying what you intend to convey about audience's preferred runtime.

Q4. Which part of the story did you not find that helpful? <br/>
A. I personally wasn't interested in whether Netflix or licensed show. That's probably because I'm a filmmaker. A producer could find that information more useful.

Q5. Considering critics rating is the only aspect you haven't brought up yet, did you find that part helpful or do you have any feedback. <br/>
A. I don't have any feedback. Yes, I did find it helpful. It was motivating to know that data. It personally pushes me to make quality products. A lot of times critics are said to bring down films in our industry but this report is testament to the fact that they are merely reflective of audience voices - that even without them, the film would go down if it was a bad film. Therefore, it does make me view critics in new light and have newfound respect for them, and also motivates me to make a better product. 

**26-year-old MSBA student @ Carnegie Mellon University**

Q1. As a business analytics student, do you believe I have made the most use of the data or are there more avenues I should dive into? <br/>
A. Considering there are titles in the list which you have informed me are infact children shows and that you plan on removing them, you should consider, on the other hand, making information about that too. The children's market is seeing a huge rise and a few child creators are richer than ever. You should talk about these children shows - get into what age groups they typically cater to and if there are patterns among them.

Q2. Which part of the story did you find most helpful/informative/fascinating? <br/>
A. I think you've seen something in the data that most people don't. Being in entertainment, it must have come naturally to you. As a person fascinated with data and data analysis, it was interesting to realize Hours viewed is a metric of performance for content on streaming. It had never occured to me that there needs to be an alternative metric for streaming like how we use box office collections for theatrical release. I also liked the rotten tomatoes analysis. I had never personally understood why there is both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. But, realizing IMDb ratings have audience ratings too and Rotten Tomatoes are all critics, I have got to appreciate for choosing Rotten Tomatoes to ensure your data is not skewed. I also liked the runtime analysis for television. It's interesting how while people glorify binging, the data tells us there is a limit to this activity of 'binging'.

Q3. Any change I should make to the visualization to ensure data speaks to you better? <br/>
A. I'm scrolling too much with the vertical rotten tomatoes bar chart. See if you can come up with something different or consider grouping the rotten tomatoes data. Group the ratings, maybe 90-100%, or 80-100%. It'll depict a trend that you intend to convey that way. Change the color of the presentation to Netflix color codes. As someone actively involved with consulting and business client, color coding goes a long with them. Try to bring that outlook to your entire presentation.

Q4. Which part of the story did you not find that helpful? <br/>
A. I didn't see myself learning much from the runtime of movies. I do watch movies below 2 hours but in general, it was not data I could relate to much.

Q5. Considering Netflix Original is the only attribute you haven't spoken about, did you find that part insightful or do you have any feedback? <br/>
A. I thought it was interesting. Considering these are titles among the top 1000, it was interesting to see how manny of them are licensed and originals. I was rather happy to see Suits in there. As someone who watched Suits back when it released, it was wholesome to see the show catch on fire when it released on Netflix. I remember wondering back then which all shows have caught fire past their release date. It was interesting all those titles in one place here.

**31-year-old PhD grad who has zero interest/idea about entertainment industry**

Q1. As someone that doesn't watch much content and isn't updated about the entertainment industry, what did you think of the story? <br/>
A. You're right. I've barely watched most of the titles on even the top 10 list. I did find it interesting though. Because you're talking audience mindsets, for me it was more informative from a psychological perspective. I was thinking about attention spans when you began talking about runtime. I was thinking about how tough it must be come up with new ideas and execute them, that platforms are majorly residing to older released shows as content. Overall, it was interesting. Hit content always speaks more about the audience than it's content, and I think thats why I was interested in what you had to tell.

Q2. Which part of the story did you find most helpful/informative/fascinating? <br/>
A. I was surprised about the rotten tomatoes rating. I always believed critics gave high ratings to artsy films - films that were slow and that nobody watched. I was actually taken aback to see so many shows on this list have 100% critics ratings. I've even watched one of them. I personally do subscribe to that rating but it was just surprising to see that a critic aligns with me too. Changed my perspective on critics and how maybe high ratings aren't given to only slow art films. 

Q3. Any change I should make to the visualization to ensure data speaks to you better? <br/>
A. As someone who's doing his PhD in biomedical engineering, I really don't work with a lot of visualizations. I assumed there would be complicated stuff but it all looks plain and simple. You could maybe also how many of the tv series were Limited series. It could reinforce the point you're trying to make with 'runtime' - that similar to how audiences wish to see shorter seasons, they maybe also want to see shorter stories.

Q4. Which part of the story did you not find that interesting/helpful? <br/>
A. I thought everything was interesting. You've tied it all back to audience mindsets and that personally kept me interested.

Q5. Considering runtime is the only attribute you haven't spoken about, did you find that part insightful or do you have any feedback? <br/>
A. Not as much as the other attributes but as someone who watches limited series alot, it was interesting to learn that other audience, even those who probably watch a lot of content, are like me too - they don't want to watch something for too long. But again, maybe that's a testament of the times we live in, how people want to see somethnig that ends quicker than something that goes on forever.


## Interview Findings and Changes I plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified:-

All three individuals found my visualization informative and intriguing. It was interesting to see how each of them focused on different aspects of the story but was comforting to know, all of them found everything useful in some manner. Even the PhD student had some appreciation for an analysis that was data heavy and concentration in a field he wasn't interested in. I therefore now strongly think the general public would be intrigued by these kind of data. They might not have much use for it, unlike creators and entertainment analytics companies, but they definitely find it interesting.
Having taken in all their feedback, the following are changes I plan on implementing to my visualization:-

1. I noticed there are atleast some of my audience that are doing the calculation to understand where some of my titles have gone. I should therefore find the space and talk more about children show titles that are present in the list, so that I am accounting for everything. I could get into the runtime of these episodes and the lengths of a season. I could try to find a pattern among them, example: what age group they cater to
2. Considering it stays within the scope and intent of my story, I should consider diving into the metrics of titles that are 'Limited Series' too. I could co-relate it with the story I intend to convey through runtime about audience's attention span. I could bring up limited series and talk about how today's audience want to see the finish line.
3. I definitely should group my data in two of my visualizations - Rotten Tomatoes visualization and Runtime for movies visualization. All individuals reported there isn't much difference in a few minutes or percentage, and I should therefore group the data.
4. I had already planned on doing this, but upon stronger feedback, I shall definitely be color coding the presentation with Netflix color codeos, for easy identifiablity and understanding for the viewer.
