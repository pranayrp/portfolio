# About me
Hailing from India, I bring a rich background in strategy consulting and the Indian film industry. Throughout my consulting career, I implemented change management processes for three Fortune 500 companies, while my tenure in the film business as an associate producersaw me engaging with prominent streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney, among others. Currently enrolled in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am gaining a comprehensive understanding of the analytical and business aspects of the global entertainment industry.  Drawing upon a well-established proficiency in interpersonal skills, agreements, and negotiations, I possess a profound enthusiasm for the acquisition, distribution, and licensing components of the entertainment industry. 

# What I hope to learn
As a fellow creator of short films, my journey into the realm of visual storytelling initially stemmed from my fascination with words. I found myself crafting vivid narratives and reshaping the world through language. However, it wasn't long before I recognized the immense power of visual storytelling. Thus, I embraced the camera as my tool of expression.</br>
Despite my love for the visual medium in my personal endeavors, I struggled with it in my professional life. I struggled with creating data visualizations and relied more on words to convey information. Determined to enhance my proficiency in this area, I have embarked on a journey to improve my data visualization skills. This portfolio serves as a documentation of my progress toward mastering the art of telling stories through data!
