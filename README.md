# Portfolio
This is Pranay Raj and this is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
Currently enrolled in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am gaining a comprehensive understanding of the analytical and business aspects of the global entertainment industry. My background includes hands-on experience in both the creative and business facets of the film and television fields. Drawing upon a well-established proficiency in interpersonal skills, agreements, and negotiations, I possess a profound enthusiasm for the acquisition, distribution, and licensing components of the entertainment industry. 

# What I hope to learn
I have always struggled with data visualizations. While communicating data, I find words much easier to use than graphs and charts. However, I am well aware that images are more effective and easily understandable. I therefore hope to get better at visualizing and communicating data through visual means.
