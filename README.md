This is Pranay Raj and this is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
Currently enrolled in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am gaining a comprehensive understanding of the analytical and business aspects of the global entertainment industry. My background includes hands-on experience in both the creative and business facets of the film and television fields. Drawing upon a well-established proficiency in interpersonal skills, agreements, and negotiations, I possess a profound enthusiasm for the acquisition, distribution, and licensing components of the entertainment industry. 

# What I hope to learn
I have always struggled with data visualizations. While communicating data, I find words much easier to use than graphs and charts. However, I am well aware that images are more effective and easily understandable. I therefore hope to get better at visualizing and communicating data through visual means.

In the Govt Debt Ratio - Heat Map above, we notice Govt Debt Ratio has increased almost three times in 27 years.  Greece's Govt Debt Ratio has increased two times and Italy's Govt. Debt Ratio has increased 1.5 times.  Certain countries like Belgium and Canada, we notice the Govt Debt ratio has remained consistently high. As we go further down the Heat Map, we encounter several countries such as Netherland and Ireland whose Govt Debt Ratio has decreased over the years. Rstonia's Govt Debt  Ratio has increased two folds over the years but it's ratio continues to be the lowest in the list.
