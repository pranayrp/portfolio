This is Pranay Raj and this is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
I'm studying Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. I love films and could watch them all day. I've recently grown really fond of cooking and hope to get better at it!

# What I hope to learn
I struggle with data visualizations. I find words much easier than graphs and charts. I hope to get better at data visualization.

# Work
