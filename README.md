This is Pranay Raj and this is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
Currently enrolled in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am gaining a comprehensive understanding of the analytical and business aspects of the global entertainment industry. My background includes hands-on experience in both the creative and business facets of the film and television fields. Drawing upon a well-established proficiency in interpersonal skills, agreements, and negotiations, I possess a profound enthusiasm for the acquisition, distribution, and licensing components of the entertainment industry. 

# What I hope to learn
I have always struggled with data visualizations. While communicating data, I find words much easier to use than graphs and charts. However, I am well aware that images are more effective and easily understandable. I therefore hope to get better at visualizing and communicating data through visual means.

The above barchart displays the Debt-to-GDP ratios for countries in 2007. While Estonia had the lowest Debt-to-GDP ratio, Japan had the highest Debt-to-GDP ratio. Japan's ratio is almost 1.5 times greater than Greece, the country with the second highest Debt-to-GDP ratio.

The above Heat Map is useful in evaluating the range of increase and decrease in Govt. Debt-to-GDP ratio for each country over the years.
We notice the Govt Debt-to-GDP ratio of Japan has increased almost threefold in 27 years.  Greece's has increased twofold and Italy's has increased by 1.5 times.  For certain countries such as Belgium and Canada, we notice the Debt-to-GDP ratio has remained consistently high. As we go further down the Heat Map, we encounter several countries such as Netherland and Ireland whose Debt-to-GDP ratio has infact decreased over the years. Estonia's Debt-to-GDP ratio has increased two folds over the years but it's ratio continues to be the lowest in the list.

The above chart displays the astronomical growth in Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio over the years. While the Debt-to-GDP ratio of many countries has increased and decreased over the years, Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio has always moved upwards. Unlike Greece or Italy, Japan's ratio has never once dipped.
For an audience attempting to estimate the average Debt-to-GDP ratio in a particular year, instead of a line chart showcasing the average Debt-to-GDP ratio over the years, the boxplots above are more accurate and useful. This is because, Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio being an outlier in most boxplots implies it would skew the average debt-to-gdp ratio if calculated. 
Hovering over each boxplot would allow audience to learn the median Debt-to-GDP ratio of a year, an equally informative summary statistic. With the median, one learns that 50% of the countries have a Debt-to-GDP above the median value and 50% have a Debt-to-GDP ratio below the median value. This is useful in understanding the growth in Debt-to-GDP for countries throughout the years.
