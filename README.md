# About me
Hailing from India, I bring a rich background in strategy consulting and the Indian film industry. Throughout my consulting career, I implemented change management processes for three Fortune 500 companies, while my tenure in the film business as an associate producersaw me engaging with prominent streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney, among others. Currently enrolled in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am gaining a comprehensive understanding of the analytical and business aspects of the global entertainment industry.  Drawing upon a well-established proficiency in interpersonal skills, agreements, and negotiations, I possess a profound enthusiasm for the acquisition, distribution, and licensing components of the entertainment industry. 

# What I hope to learn

Years ago, I discovered my passion for writing. I found that I could express myself better through words. However, it wasn't too long before I realized the power of the visual medium in storytelling. And so, I picked up the camera. Despite my love for video in my personal endeavors as a short filmmaker, I still struggled to visualize data and relied more on words to convey information in my professional life. That's why I have decided to improve my data visualization skills. This portfolio documents my journey towards becoming better at telling stories through data.
