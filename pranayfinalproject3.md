## Final Project Summary

When I initally began the project (in Final Project 1), I believed my audiences were entertainment analytics companies. As I began working more and more, I believed my audiences were entertainment analytics companies and filmmakers. However, I was still sure there was something I was missing. Gor my user research survey I performed in Part II, I ended up interviewing my filmmaker friend from back home. I found it interesting how she mentioned this data would help her while pitching to platforms. That's when it struck me about who my audience realy were - Filmmakers and Netflix executives. 

What initially began as enthusiasm to just break down this unorganized data released by Netflix became more about what this data could actually inform us and where it could be useful. My call to action in **Final project I** was to show entertainment analytics companies how the Netflix Engagement Report, which looks as unorganized as a data dump, is actually extremely informative for entertainment analytics purposes. But,having realized my audience, my call to action now is two seperate messages. "If you're a filmmaker, the data is meant to inform you to focus on your product, to make it tight if possible, and to never lose hope as good shows have always found their limelight."
"If you're a Netflix executive, you should consider releasing data in this format, as this could inform filmmakers of the kind of content you prefer and are looking for, essentially reducing the need to uncover bad products"

With Part I and 2, as my initial sketches indicate, the idea was to create a pie chart for no. of licensed shows, to create a boxplot for runtime and a bar chart for rotten tomatoes ratings. But, as I progress further on my data visualization journeys, the charts I chose changed. When I discussed my Rotten Tomatoes (RT) bar chart with my peers, their feedback was that it seemed too much with me detailing the number of hours for each title. They suggested I group my ratings for easier understanding and I did the same. However, during the same time, I finally recognized and confirmed my audience and the story I wished to convey. According to the story I wished to convey, my chart became more about the total number of titles with higher rating in the top 500 list than thoe with higher hours. My user research group also suggested I dive into the genres of the titles with low ratings and hence, I did so in my final presentation. I initially planned to create a pie for the number of shows licensed, but much like with the RT chart, when I figured the story for this - I realized a horizontal bar chart was more appropriate. I was initially doubtful how I would go about illustrating runtime for these titles. I then came upon the treemap, which was perfect to showcase most preferred runtimes. During my Part II runthrough with my peers, they suggested I group my movie runtimes too. I went ahead and made that change to the visalization too. I initially planned on diving into the titles that were meant for children. While there are insights there, they didn't sit well with the story I intended to convey and hence, left them out.
